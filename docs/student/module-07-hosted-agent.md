# Module 7 - Deploy the containerized agent as a hosted agent

## Objective
Deploy the same Agent Framework triage agent to **Foundry Agent Service** as a **hosted agent**, test it with the same business scenarios, review logs, compare it with the local version, and clean up.

## Status and availability (verify before delivery)
- Microsoft Learn (Agent Framework hosting) states that **Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents is generally available**.
- `azd ai agent init` is marked **preview**, and the Python hosting package `agent-framework-foundry-hosting` is a **prerelease** build.
- Hosted agents are available in a [documented list of regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents#region-availability) (including UAE North at the time of writing).
- Container images must be **linux/amd64**; the container serves port **8088**; the platform provides `/readiness` routing, a dedicated Microsoft Entra **agent identity**, and a dedicated endpoint.

## Prerequisites
- Module 3 completed (Module 5 optional). **Module 6 is optional** — `azd` builds the image remotely in Azure Container Registry, so you don't need a locally built image.
- **Foundry Project Manager** role at project scope (needed to deploy hosted agents). See [prerequisites.md](../prerequisites.md#roles).
- Azure Developer CLI `azd` 1.27.1 or later with the Foundry extensions (install the [Foundry Dev Pack](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/how-to/develop/install-cli-sdk), or run `azd extension install azure.ai.agents`). Validated with `azd` 1.34.1 and `azure.ai.agents` 1.0.0-beta.16.
- Docker isn't required for the deployment itself: `azd` builds the image remotely in Azure Container Registry.
- Your **project resource ID**: in the Foundry portal select **Manage** > **Project details** and copy **Resource ID**. Keep it in your private notes; don't commit it.

## Concepts introduced
- **Hosted agent**: your container, run by Foundry in per-session, VM-isolated sandboxes that scale to zero after an idle timeout (2-60 minutes, default 15).
- **Agent identity**: created at deploy time; it can call models in the project by default. Other resources (for example the search service) need explicit role assignments.
- **azure.yaml**: the single azd manifest for the project, model, and agent service.
- **Deploy modes**: `container` (Dockerfile, used here) or `code` (ZIP upload and remote build).

## Starting state
`python scripts/lab_state.py status` shows 3.1a to 3.5b enabled (and 5.1 if you completed Module 5). If you did Module 6, the local container works; if you skipped it, that's fine — `azd` builds the image in Azure.

## Resources used
Foundry project (existing), model deployment, Azure Container Registry (created or selected by `azd`), hosted agent compute (billed while sessions are active), optional search service.

## Steps

### 7.1 Sign in and check tools
```powershell
azd version
azd extension list
azd auth login
```
`azure.ai.agents` must be installed and compatible with your `azd` version. If `azd` reports an incompatible extension, update `azd` first.

**What you should see** (captured 7 October 2026 with `azd` 1.34.1):

```text
PS> azd version
azd version 1.34.1 (commit ...) (stable)

PS> azd extension list
ID                   NAME                         STATUS         INSTALLED       LATEST
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
azure.ai.agents      Foundry agents (Beta)        Up to date     1.0.0-beta.16   1.0.0-beta.16
microsoft.foundry    Microsoft Foundry (Beta)     Up to date     1.0.0-beta.2    1.0.0-beta.2
...
```

> **If step 7.1 fails in the terminal (common):** the Foundry extension auto-updated to a build that your `azd` version doesn't support, so `azd extension list` shows `azure.ai.agents` with **STATUS = Incompatible** and later `azd ai agent …` commands may fail or print a warning. (A mismatch often still runs with a warning, but if a command errors out, this is the usual cause.) Fix it by matching the versions:
>
> ```powershell
> azd version                                     # note your azd version
> azd extension list                              # look for "Incompatible" in the STATUS column
> # Option A (recommended): update azd, then the extension
> powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
> azd extension update azure.ai.agents
> # Option B: pin the extension build this lab was validated with
> azd extension install azure.ai.agents --version 1.0.0-beta.16
> ```
>
> Re-run `azd extension list` and confirm `azure.ai.agents` shows **Up to date** (or at least not **Incompatible**) before continuing.

### 7.2 Initialize the azd project around the existing code
From the **repository root**:

```powershell
azd ai agent init --src ./app --agent-name issue-triage-hosted --deploy-mode container `
  --project-id "<project-resource-id>" --model-deployment "<model-deployment-name>" --protocol responses -e triage-lab
```
Answer the prompts. When asked about a container registry, prefer an **existing** registry your instructor provides (or pass `--acr-connection <connection-name>`).

> **Instructor-led workshop:** use the registry named in your handout (`Registry (Module 7)`). **Select the existing registry; never accept the "create a new registry" option**, and don't use `--no-prompt`. Your instructor already gave you permission to build images in that registry and gave your project permission to pull from it. After your hosted agent is deployed, send your instructor the agent identity's principal ID (see 7.7) so they can grant it access to the shared search service.

> **Cost warning (validated):** with `--no-prompt`, or if you accept a new registry, `azd` creates a **new resource group** named `rg-<environment>-foundry` (for example `rg-triage-lab-foundry`) with a **Premium** Azure Container Registry, billed daily. Delete that resource group during cleanup ([cost-and-cleanup.md](../cost-and-cleanup.md)).

The command generates `azure.yaml` at the repository root, `app/.agentignore`, and an `.azure/<environment>` folder (ignored by Git). It doesn't overwrite your code.

> **Warning (from Microsoft Learn):** when you initialize against an existing project with `--project-id`, the tooling skips the automatic role assignments it performs for new projects. Your instructor must confirm the roles in the [role checklist](../instructor-guide.md#role-checklist).

### 7.3 Review and complete azure.yaml
1. Open the generated `azure.yaml` and compare it with [deployment/azure.yaml.reference](../../deployment/azure.yaml.reference). Keep what `azd` generated; only add what's missing. In validation, `azd` generated:
   - `ai-project` with `endpoint: ${FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}` (connects to your existing project),
   - the agent service with `language: docker`, `docker: remoteBuild: true` (the image is built in Azure Container Registry, so local Docker isn't needed), `kind: hosted`, the `responses` protocol, `startupCommand: python main.py`, and `cpu: "0.5"` / `memory: 1Gi`,
   - `env: AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: ${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}` (the app accepts this name as well as `MICROSOFT_FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`).
2. Add these entries under the agent service `env:` if you completed Module 5:

   ```yaml
   AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT: ${AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT}
   AZURE_SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME: ${AZURE_SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME}
   LOG_LEVEL: INFO
   ```
   Don't add `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` or other `FOUNDRY_*` variables: the platform injects them.
3. Set the values in the azd environment (stored under `.azure/`, not in source):

   ```powershell
   azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT https://<search-service>.search.windows.net -e triage-lab   # Module 5 only
   azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME kbtriage -e triage-lab                           # Module 5 only (shared workshop: your own name, for example kbtriage-s01)
   ```

### 7.4 Provision (and optionally test locally with azd)
```powershell
azd provision -e triage-lab
```
Validated: about 1-2 minutes; it creates the container registry and its project connection. Optional: `azd ai agent run` starts the agent locally with the `startupCommand` and opens the Agent Inspector; in a second terminal, `azd ai agent invoke --local "Triage issue ISS-1001"`. Stop it with **Ctrl+C**.

### 7.5 Deploy the hosted agent
```powershell
azd deploy -e triage-lab
```
`azd` packages the `app` folder, builds the image in Azure Container Registry, creates a hosted agent version, and polls until it's active (validated: about 2.5 minutes). The output ends with `SUCCESS` and the next steps (`azd ai agent show`, `azd ai agent invoke`).

**What you should see** (abbreviated):

```text
Packaging services (azd deploy)
  (✓) Done: Packaging service issue-triage-hosted
Deploying services (azd deploy)
  (✓) Done: Building image in Azure Container Registry
  (✓) Done: Deploying hosted agent issue-triage-hosted (version 1)
  Waiting for agent version to become active... active

SUCCESS: Your application was deployed to Azure in 2 minutes 30 seconds.

Next steps:
  - Show status:  azd ai agent show issue-triage-hosted -e triage-lab
  - Invoke agent: azd ai agent invoke issue-triage-hosted "Hello" -e triage-lab
```

> - **Screen**: terminal showing a successful `azd deploy -e triage-lab` - the Packaging and Deploying steps with green checks, the `SUCCESS` line, and the two "Next steps" commands.

> - **Redact**: subscription/tenant IDs, resource IDs, and your user name. See [docs/images/README.md](../images/README.md).

### 7.6 Verify deployment status
```powershell
azd ai agent show issue-triage-hosted -e triage-lab --output json
```
Check `"status": "active"`, the `container_configuration.image`, the `environment_variables`, `agent_endpoints.responses`, and `instance_identity.principal_id` (the agent identity). In the Foundry portal, `issue-triage-hosted` appears under **Build** > **Agents** with type **Hosted**.

**What you should see** (trimmed JSON; your IDs and endpoints differ):

```json
{
  "name": "issue-triage-hosted",
  "status": "active",
  "container_configuration": { "image": "<registry>.azurecr.io/issue-triage-hosted:1" },
  "agent_endpoints": { "responses": "https://<project-endpoint>/.../responses" },
  "instance_identity": { "principal_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" }
}
```

**Get the agent identity's principal ID (needed for step 7.7).** The principal ID is the `instance_identity.principal_id` value in the JSON above. Rather than copy it by hand, capture it into a variable by parsing the JSON output:

```powershell
$agentJson = azd ai agent show issue-triage-hosted -e triage-lab --output json | ConvertFrom-Json
$agentPrincipalId = $agentJson.instance_identity.principal_id
$agentPrincipalId      # prints the GUID, for example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

If `$agentPrincipalId` is empty, the agent isn't `active` yet - wait a minute and run `azd ai agent show` again. You can also read the same value in the Foundry portal: **Build** > **Agents** > `issue-triage-hosted` > **Hosted agent details** (or the agent YAML), under the agent (instance) identity. Keep this GUID in your private notes; you'll pass it to the role script next.

> **SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER** - `docs/images/m07-azd-agent-show.png`
> - **Screen**: terminal showing `azd ai agent show ... --output json` with `"status": "active"` and the container image, endpoints, and `instance_identity.principal_id` visible.
> - **Navigation**: run step 7.6 after a successful deploy.
> - **Redact**: the project endpoint, resource IDs, and the `principal_id` GUID. See [docs/images/README.md](../images/README.md).

### 7.7 Grant the agent identity access to the knowledge base (Module 5 only)
From the repository root, use the agent principal ID you captured in step 7.6 (either the `$agentPrincipalId` variable, or paste the GUID):

```powershell
./deployment/assign-hosted-agent-roles.ps1 -AgentPrincipalId $agentPrincipalId `
    -SearchServiceName <search-service> -ResourceGroup <lab-resource-group>
```
This assigns **Search Index Data Reader** and **Reader** on the lab search service only. Both are required: without **Reader**, the agent fails with `Operation returned an invalid status 'Forbidden'` because the knowledge base provider can't read the knowledge base definition. Role assignments can take a few minutes.

### 7.8 Invoke the hosted agent with the same scenarios
```powershell
azd ai agent invoke issue-triage-hosted "Triage issue ISS-1014" -e triage-lab
azd ai agent invoke issue-triage-hosted "Why did you choose that priority?" -e triage-lab     # same session
azd ai agent invoke issue-triage-hosted "Triage issue ISS-1001" -e triage-lab --new-session  # KI-2041 if Module 5 is enabled
```
Validated results: ISS-1014 is `ROAMING` / `P1` / Roaming Desk (1 hour); the follow-up explains the P1 using the earlier turn; ISS-1001 shows `Known issue: KI-2041`. The output also shows the conversation, session, and trace IDs. You can also chat with `issue-triage-hosted` in the portal playground.

**What you should see** (for `Triage issue ISS-1014`; abbreviated):

```text
Invoking agent issue-triage-hosted...
status: completed   conversation: conv_...   session: sess_...   trace: ...

Category: ROAMING
Priority: P1 - critical
Routed team: Roaming Desk, first-response SLA 1 hour
Known issue: None
Safety flags: none
```

> - **Screen**: terminal showing `azd ai agent invoke issue-triage-hosted "Triage issue ISS-1014"` - the status line with conversation/session/trace IDs and the triage card (Category ROAMING, Priority P1, Roaming Desk).
> - **Navigation**: run step 7.8 after a successful deploy.
> - **Redact**: the session/trace IDs. See [docs/images/README.md](../images/README.md).

### 7.9 Review logs and diagnostics
```powershell
azd ai agent monitor issue-triage-hosted -e triage-lab
azd ai agent monitor issue-triage-hosted -e triage-lab --follow
```
Look for `Starting issue-triage-agent (knowledge base: on) on port 8088` and the `[tool call]` lines. A startup line `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agents'` comes from an optional tracing plug-in and is harmless. If Application Insights is connected to the project (Module 8), the platform injects `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`.

### 7.10 Compare local and hosted behaviour
| Aspect | Local CLI / container | Hosted agent |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Your `az login` user (or dev tokens in the container) | Platform-created agent identity |
| Endpoint | `localhost:8088` | `{project_endpoint}/agents/issue-triage-hosted/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses` |
| Conversation | CLI session object / single requests | Platform-managed sessions (`--new-session` resets) |
| Scale and cost | Your machine | Per-session sandboxes, scale to zero after the idle timeout; billed for active CPU and memory |
| Logs | Terminal / `docker logs` | `azd ai agent monitor`, Application Insights |

### 7.11 Clean up the hosted deployment
When you've finished Modules 8 and 9 (or if your instructor asks you to stop now):

```powershell
azd ai agent delete issue-triage-hosted --force -e triage-lab
```
`--force` terminates active sessions. Don't run `azd down` against a shared or existing project unless your instructor confirms what it deletes. In an instructor-led workshop, delete only your own hosted agent: the registry and resource group are shared and your instructor removes them. Otherwise remove the `azd`-created resource group (`rg-<environment>-foundry`, which holds the Premium container registry) and the lab resource group as described in [cost-and-cleanup.md](../cost-and-cleanup.md).

## Expected output
- `azd deploy` ends with the agent playground link and endpoint.
- `azd ai agent show` reports an active version.
- `invoke` returns triage cards equivalent to the local results; the follow-up question uses the earlier turn.

## Verification checkpoint
- [ ] The hosted agent answers ISS-1014 as `ROAMING` / `P1`.
- [ ] `azd ai agent monitor` shows tool calls.
- [ ] (Module 5) ISS-1001 links to `KI-2041`.

## Common errors and recovery
| Symptom | Likely cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `azure.ai.agents` extension incompatible (`STATUS = Incompatible`), `azd ai agent …` fails in the terminal | `azd` and the Foundry extension versions don't match (the extension auto-updated) | Update `azd`, then `azd extension update --all` (or pin with `azd extension install azure.ai.agents --version 1.0.0-beta.16`). See the detailed note in step 7.1. |
| Authorization error during deploy | Missing **Foundry Project Manager** | Ask the instructor; wait a few minutes after assignment. |
| Image pull failure | Project managed identity lacks registry access | Instructor assigns **Container Registry Repository Reader** on the registry. |
| Agent version fails to start | Module 3 steps not enabled in the image, or a missing environment variable | `azd ai agent monitor`; `python scripts/lab_state.py upto 3.5`; check `env:` in `azure.yaml`; `azd deploy` again. |
| `agent failed (server_error): Operation returned an invalid status 'Forbidden'` | Agent identity lacks **Reader** and/or **Search Index Data Reader** on the search service | Run the role script in step 7.7; wait 2-5 minutes; invoke again. |
| Remote build fails with `the --mount option requires BuildKit` | A Dockerfile uses BuildKit-only syntax | Azure Container Registry builds don't support it; use the provided Dockerfile. |
| Region not supported | Region not in the hosted-agent list | Use a supported region for the lab project. |

## Knowledge check
1. Which identity does the hosted agent use to call the model?
2. Why must you not declare `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` in `azure.yaml`?
3. When does a hosted agent stop consuming compute?

<details><summary>Answers</summary>

1. Its platform-created Microsoft Entra agent identity.
2. The platform injects it; `FOUNDRY_*` names are reserved.
3. After the idle timeout with no requests (default 15 minutes); the session state is persisted.

> **Documentation gaps:** (1) The documentation doesn't state that, without an existing registry, `azd ai agent init` creates a separate `rg-<environment>-foundry` resource group with a Premium registry (observed in validation). (2) The knowledge base provider's need for the **Reader** role isn't documented. (3) The agent identity principal ID is available as `instance_identity.principal_id` in `azd ai agent show --output json` (validated) and in the agent YAML.
