# Cost and cleanup

No prices are quoted here because they depend on region, model, usage, and agreement. Use the official pricing pages and the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

## What can incur charges

| Resource | Charged for | Charges while idle? | Pricing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat model deployment | Tokens processed (agent, Prompt Agent, knowledge-base query planning) | Standard / GlobalStandard deployments: usage-based | [Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-openai/) |
| Embedding model deployment | Tokens for indexing the knowledge documents | Usage-based | same |
| Judge model for evaluations | Tokens used by AI-assisted evaluators | Usage-based | same |
| Foundry Agent Service (hosted agents) | CPU and memory of **active sessions** | No compute charge after the idle timeout (default 15 minutes); session state is kept | [Foundry Agent Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/foundry-agent-service/) |
| Azure AI Search | Tier (Free or Basic); agentic retrieval tokens | **Basic and higher tiers are billed while they exist**; Free tier has no charge but has limits | [Azure AI Search pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) |
| Azure Container Registry | SKU per day, storage | **Yes**, while it exists. `azd ai agent init` without an existing registry created a **Premium** registry in a separate `rg-<environment>-foundry` resource group in validation. | [Container Registry pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/) |
| Application Insights / Log Analytics | Data ingested and retained | Ingestion-based | [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) |
| Storage account | Data stored and operations (very small for this lab) | Yes, tiny | [Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) |

Microsoft Learn states that you can use the Free tier for Azure AI Search and a free allocation of tokens for agentic retrieval for proof-of-concept testing. Check the current limits on the pricing page. A subscription can have only one Free search service; if it's already used, the lab needs Basic.

For scale: the validation run (all modules, one person) showed an estimated agent cost of about USD 0.06 in the Foundry **Monitor** tab for ~25 agent runs. Fixed daily costs (Basic search, Premium registry) dominate; delete them promptly.

## Keep costs low
- For a class that shares infrastructure, see [Shared workshop infrastructure](instructor-guide.md#shared-workshop-infrastructure). One Standard search service (billed hourly while it exists) is the main fixed cost: create it shortly before the workshop and remove it with `deployment/remove-workshop-infra.ps1` right after.
- Use the smallest hosted agent size (0.5 vCPU / 1 GiB) and don't change the idle timeout upwards.
- Use the Free search tier if available.
- Don't enable continuous or scheduled evaluations or red-team scans in Monitor settings.
- Run the local scorer with `--limit` while experimenting.
- Delete the resource group at the end of the workshop.

## Cleanup steps

> **Instructor-led workshop with shared infrastructure:** students do only steps 1-3 and delete only their own agents. The instructor then removes the shared search service, Application Insights and workspace with [remove-workshop-infra.ps1](../deployment/remove-workshop-infra.ps1). **Don't run steps 5 and 6 on the shared resource group:** it also holds the Foundry resource, the projects and a registry that may pre-date the workshop. In step 4, students delete only their own `kstriage-<id>` and `kbtriage-<id>` if the search service is kept.

Do these in order at the end of the workshop.

1. **Local container**
   ```powershell
   docker stop triage-agent           # if still running
   docker image rm issue-triage-agent:1.0 issue-triage-agent:lab-test
   Remove-Item app/.env.container -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```
2. **Hosted agent** (from the repository root, where `azure.yaml` is)
   ```powershell
   azd ai agent delete issue-triage-hosted --force -e <azd-environment>
   ```
3. **Lab agents** (Prompt Agent and any remaining hosted agent)
   ```powershell
   python scripts/delete_lab_agents.py
   ```
4. **Uploaded knowledge files** (if you keep the resource group): delete the `kstriageknowledge` knowledge source (**Build** > **Knowledge** > `kbtriage` > options > **Delete permanently**), or for option A delete the `triageknowledge` blob container.
5. **The azd-created resource group** (if `azd` created one, for example `rg-triage-lab-foundry` with the Premium container registry)
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/cleanup-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroup rg-<azd-environment>-foundry
   ```
6. **The lab resource group** (removes everything in it: Foundry resource and project, deployments, guardrails, knowledge base, search service, storage, Application Insights, Log Analytics)
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/cleanup-lab.ps1 -ResourceGroup <your-lab-resource-group>
   ```
   The script shows the resources, asks you to type the resource group name, deletes it, and verifies that it's gone.
7. **Verify**
   ```powershell
   az group exists --name <your-lab-resource-group>        # false
   az group exists --name rg-<azd-environment>-foundry     # false
   az cognitiveservices account list-deleted -o table      # soft-deleted Foundry resources
   ```
   Foundry (Cognitive Services) resources are soft-deleted. Purge only your lab resource, and only if your policy allows: `az cognitiveservices account purge --name <name> --resource-group <rg> --location <region>`.
8. **Local files**: delete `app/.env`, `azure.yaml` and `app/.agentignore` (generated by `azd`), `.azure/`, `.lab-backup/`, and `evaluation/results/` if you don't need them.

> Only delete resources created for this lab. If an action would affect an existing or shared resource, stop and ask the instructor.

## Data and privacy
These services store or process interaction data during the lab:
- **Foundry Agent Service**: agent definitions, versions, conversations, and hosted agent sessions (deleted after 30 days of inactivity).
- **Model deployments**: prompts and completions are processed by the model service.
- **Azure AI Search and Blob Storage**: the knowledge documents and their index.
- **Application Insights**: traces that can contain prompts, responses, and tool arguments.
- **Foundry project data**: the uploaded evaluation dataset and results.

The lab uses only synthetic data. Before using real data, review:
