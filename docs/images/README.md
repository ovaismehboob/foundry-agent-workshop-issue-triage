# Images and screenshots

Store lab screenshots in this folder with the naming convention `m<module>-<short-description>.png` (for example `m04-knowledge-base.png`). Reference them from Markdown with relative paths, for example `![alt text](../images/m04-knowledge-base.png)` written inside a page in `docs/student/`.

## Rules for screenshots
- Prefer current official Microsoft images; link to them with their source instead of copying them.
- Capture from the lab subscription only when no suitable official image exists.
- Before adding a screenshot, crop or mask: subscription and tenant IDs, user names and emails, keys, tokens, connection strings, resource IDs, private endpoints, unrelated resources, notifications, browser profile, other tabs, and account menus. Non-sensitive names of lab resources may stay visible.
- Never fabricate or edit portal images to show UI that doesn't exist.
- Keep images readable (at least 1200 px wide for full-page captures); add a caption, alt text, and "what to observe".

## Screenshots captured from the lab tenant (5 October 2026)

Captured from a dedicated lab project (`projtriagelab`) in the Microsoft Non-Production tenant. They show only lab resource names; no subscription or tenant IDs, user names, keys, or account menus are visible. They were checked before they were added.
