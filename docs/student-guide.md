# Student guide - Contoso Telecom Issue Triage Assistant

In this lab you build one application, the **Issue Triage Assistant** for the fictional operator Contoso Telecom, and extend it step by step. You end up with an AI agent that runs locally, in a container, and as a Microsoft Foundry hosted agent. It is grounded in company knowledge, governed with guardrails, monitored, and evaluated.

All data is synthetic. Contoso Telecom, its customers, areas, and incidents are fictional.

## What the assistant does

| Customer use case | Where you build it |
|---|---|
| Issue classification into predefined categories | Module 2 (keywords), Module 3 (agent) |
| Context and keyword use for categorisation | Module 2 compared with Module 3 |
| Prioritisation and routing to the right team | Module 2 rules, Module 3.3 routing tool |
| Acknowledgment with relevant details and troubleshooting steps | Module 3.2 onwards |
| Notification that links an issue to an existing solution | Module 4 (portal) and Module 5 (app) with Foundry IQ |

## Workshop day at a glance (instructor-led)

If your instructor gave you an account and a **handout**, this is your path. Everything shared (search service, container registry, monitoring, model deployments, guardrail) is **already created for you**. You don't create Azure resources or assign roles.

**What you receive:** (1) your lab account and a **Temporary Access Pass** (a one-time sign-in code that replaces your password), and (2) a handout file `<your-id>.env.txt` with your project endpoint, the shared search endpoint, and **your own names** (for example `kbtriage-s01`).

**Signing in:** open a private browser window, go to [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com), sign in with your lab account, and enter the Temporary Access Pass when asked. Open **your own project** (the name your instructor gave you). If the pass expires, ask your instructor for a new one.

| Module | You do | Already done for you / skip |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create the Prompt Agent in your project | - |
| 2 | Set up Python and run the rules-based app | - |
| 3 | Copy the lines from your handout into `app/.env`, then do the exercises | Nothing to look up in the portal: the handout has your endpoint |
| 4 | Create **your** knowledge source and knowledge base on the shared search service (**File upload**), connect it to your agent | Search service, roles, embedding model. **Skip** creating a search service or storage account |
| 5 | Put your search endpoint and knowledge base name in `app/.env`, enable step 5.1, run the tests | Search roles |
| 6 | Build and run the container (needs Docker) | - |
| 7 | `azd ai agent init` (pick the **existing** registry), `azd deploy`, invoke your agent | Registry and its access. **Never** create a new registry. **Don't** run the role script: send your agent's principal ID to the instructor |
| 8 | Assign the instructor's guardrail to your agent, test it, connect the shared Application Insights, read traces | Guardrail, Application Insights. **Skip** creating a guardrail or Application Insights |
| 9 | Upload your dataset, run the evaluation, change the instructions, compare | Judge model: use the one your instructor names |

**Three rules for a shared workshop**
1. Use only **your own** names (project, `kbtriage-<id>`, `kstriage-<id>`). Other students' objects are visible on the shared search service; leave them alone.
2. If you see "forbidden" or "authorization failed", wait about five minutes (permissions take time to apply), then tell your instructor which step failed.
3. Never paste your Temporary Access Pass, keys, or tokens into code, chat, or screenshots.

## Get the lab files

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ovaismehboob/foundry-agent-lab-issue-triage.git
cd foundry-agent-lab-issue-triage
code .
```

The repository starts in the **starter state**. Check it with `python scripts/lab_state.py status` after the Module 2 setup; every LAB STEP shows "commented out". Each student uses their own Azure resources (or the project the instructor gives them) and their own `app/.env`, which Git ignores.

## How the coding exercises work

You don't type long code listings. The code is already in the repository, commented out, between markers like this:

```python
    # ===== LAB STEP 3.3: UNCOMMENT THIS SECTION (expose app functions as tools and log every tool call) =====
    # tools = agent_tools()
    # middleware = [tool_logging_middleware()]
    # ===== END LAB STEP 3.3 =====
```

To enable a step:

1. Open the file named in the exercise (usually `app/triage_desk/agent_factory.py`).
2. Select only the commented code lines **between** the two marker lines. Don't select the marker lines.
3. Press **Ctrl+/** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+/** (macOS) to uncomment them, and save the file.
4. Check that the file still compiles:

   ```powershell
   python -m pytest tests/test_lab_files.py -k compile
   ```

If you get stuck, don't fix it by hand. Use the lab-state script from the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/lab_state.py status        # which LAB STEPs are enabled
python scripts/lab_state.py upto 3.3      # enable every step up to 3.3 (catch up)
python scripts/lab_state.py reset         # back to the starter state
python scripts/lab_state.py solution      # completed reference state
```

The script copies your current files to `.lab-backup/` before it changes them. The completed reference code is in [solution/app/triage_desk](../solution/app/triage_desk).

## Conventions

- Commands are shown for **PowerShell** on Windows. On macOS or Linux, activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` and use `/` in paths.
- Run app commands from the `app` folder: `python -m triage_desk ...`
- Run scripts and tests from the repository root.
- **Never** paste keys, tokens, or connection strings into source files, chat prompts, or screenshots. Configuration goes in `app/.env`, which Git ignores.
- AI responses vary between runs. "Expected output" sections describe what you should see, not exact text.
- **Instructor-led workshop:** your instructor gives you a handout (`<student>.env.txt`) with your project endpoint, the shared search endpoint, and your own knowledge base and knowledge source names (for example `kbtriage-s01`). You don't create Azure resources or assign roles. Skip the steps that say to create a search service, storage account, container registry or Application Insights, and work only with your own project and names.

## Record your values

Keep a private note (not in the repository) with the values you collect:

| Value | Collected in | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| Project endpoint | Module 1 (or your handout) | Modules 3, 5, 7, 9 |
| Model deployment name | Module 1 (or your handout) | Modules 3, 7 |
| Prompt Agent name and version | Module 1 | Module 3 |
| Search service endpoint | Module 4 (or your handout) | Modules 5, 7 |
| Knowledge base name | Module 4 (or your handout, for example `kbtriage-s01`) | Modules 5, 7 |
| Project resource ID | Module 7 | Module 7 |
| Hosted agent name | Module 7 | Modules 8, 9 |
