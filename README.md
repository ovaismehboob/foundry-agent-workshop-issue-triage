# Microsoft Foundry Agent Lab - Contoso Telecom Issue Triage Assistant

A hands-on, instructor-led lab that takes one small Python application through the full lifecycle of a Microsoft Foundry agent: build, ground, containerize, host, govern, monitor, and evaluate.

The application triages customer issues for **Contoso Telecom**, a fictional operator. It covers five customer use cases:

1. **Issue classification** into predefined categories (network, device/SIM, billing, roaming, account, service complaint).
2. **Context and keyword use** for categorisation: a keyword baseline compared with a context-aware agent.
3. **Prioritisation and routing** to the right team, with routing enforced by policy.
4. **Acknowledgments** with relevant details and troubleshooting steps for the issue type.
5. **Notifications** that link an issue to an existing solution or known incident, using Foundry IQ.

All data is synthetic. No real customers, incidents, or credentials are included.

## Technology and status
- **Microsoft Foundry (new)** projects and `azure-ai-projects` 2.x. Not compatible with Foundry (classic) samples.
- **Microsoft Agent Framework** for Python, pinned versions in [app/requirements.txt](app/requirements.txt). The hosting and Azure AI Search integrations are prerelease packages.
- Several features used here are in **preview** (agent guardrails, Foundry IQ portal experience, tracing and monitoring dashboard, `azd ai agent init`). See [prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md) and the [instructor guide](docs/instructor-guide.md#preview-feature-risks).

## Costs
The lab creates billable Azure resources (model usage, Azure AI Search, Container Registry, hosted agent compute, Application Insights). Use a dedicated resource group and follow [cost-and-cleanup.md](docs/cost-and-cleanup.md) at the end.
